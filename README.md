SpeCode Fusion - Automated Compatibility Checker for SRS and Source Code

SpeCode is a tool designed to verify the compatibility between Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) and source code. It leverages Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing and the Gemini API to extract functionalities from source code. Additionally, it uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract key requirements from the SRS document. The system then compares the extracted functionalities and requirements to detect inconsistencies, provides a structured compatibility report, and generates code suggestions for missing requirements.

Key Features

📌 Source Code & SRS Upload – Accepts ZIP files (source code) and PDF files (SRS).

🏗 AST-Based Code Analysis – Extracts functionalities from source code.

🔮 Gemini API-Powered Functionality Prediction – Enhances AST extraction by predicting functionalities.

🤖 NLP-Powered Requirement Extraction – Identifies and processes key requirements from the SRS.

🔍 Automated Compatibility Check – Compares extracted functionalities with requirements to detect mismatches.

📊 Real-Time Report Generation – Provides a structured report on the compatibility analysis.

🛠 Code Suggestions for Missing Requirements – Generates recommended code snippets for uncovered requirements.

🔐 Google Authentication – Secure access to user data and saved analysis results.

Usage

1️⃣ Upload your source code (ZIP) and SRS document (PDF).

2️⃣ The system extracts functionalities and requirements using AST, Gemini API, and NLP.

3️⃣ It compares the extracted data and generates a compatibility report.

4️⃣ If any requirements are missing, the system suggests code snippets to address them.

5️⃣ View the results, apply suggested changes, and download the report.
